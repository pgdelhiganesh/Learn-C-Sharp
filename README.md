- **using System** means that we can use classes from the **System** namespace.
- **namespace** is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.
- **class** is a container for data and methods.
- Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ;.
- C# is **case-sensitive**: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
- Unlike Java, the name of the C# file does not have to match the class name
